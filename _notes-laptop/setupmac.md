## Backup

I like to kep the backup live and synced, there are many software which can do that, my prefereance is Google drive to keep the backup

Backup and Sync from google

https://www.google.com/intl/en-GB_ALL/drive/download/backup-and-sync/


I was not able to make the sync use the same directory from the new computer. so what I did , Downloaded the files down to new machine and deleted the old computer.
Then setup new computer to sync.


## Simlinks

I use simlinks from User home to Directories which I use very often, ie, CODE

## Python

anaconda

https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual#macos

Since I use IntellIj and pycharm, both of the IDEs can use and manage conda envs automatically
We just have to go to project setting and add SDKs

Along with it I use conda env in command line as well 

And tools like jupyter from the navogator itself

## IDE

install jetbrains tools box and isntall intellJ 
int plugins
* Scala
* AWS toolkit
* Kubenetes
* bigdata tools
* EDU tools

## Container

Docker for desktop 
Go to setting and 
    increse the memory assigned
    check for enable kubenetes
