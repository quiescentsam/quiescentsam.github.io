We got the below error , while doing the backup based rman duplicate.
RMAN command for duplicate is below.

```shell
RUN{ 
set archivelog destination to '/${target}_archredo1/redologs/'; 
allocate auxiliary channel ch01 device type 'SBT_TAPE' parms 'ENV=(NB_ORA_CLIENT=$client,BLKSIZE=1048576)' maxopenfiles 1; 
allocate channel aux1 device type disk; 
duplicate target database to ${target} 
UNTIL TIME "to_date('$until_time','mm-dd-yyyy hh24:mi:ss')" 
pfile = /oracle/app/oracle/admin/$target/pfile/init$target.ora; 
} 
```

Recovery part of the duplication started failing with below error

```shell
RMAN-03015: error occurred in stored script Memory Script

ORA-10877: error signaled in parallel recovery slave
```

When I checked the alert log of the destination database , we found below error

```shell

```

This suggested that RMAN was looking for the Block change tracking file to perform the recovery.
Since the path of the BCT file was not present in destination, I decided to disable the change tracking at source itself.

```shell
SQL>alter database disable block change tracking;

Database altered.
```

That did not help , even after disabling the change tracking at source did not help  .Since my recover time was some time in the past , the controlfile which was restore by RMAN was always looking for change tracking file.

Then I tried to create a dummy file with same name as source change tracking file , but the recovery was failing again, with below message

```shell
Media Recovery failed with error 19755

```

Then I realized that, RMAN needs BCT file for restore , I re enabled change tracking at source

```shell
SQL> alter database enable block change tracking using FILE '/source_db01/oracle/rman_change_trck_dwprod1.dbf';

Database altered.
```

Manually copied the file to destination to same path and started the recovery again .
This did the trick and recovery started.

** Note 1 : ** Please include location of BCT file in DB_FILE_NAME_CONVERT parameter as well

** Note 2: **  I don't know if BCT file is backed by RMAN. IF you know , please drop your answer in comments

Note 3: Another great piece of info aboutt BCT I found on some blog
The size of the change tracking file is proportional to the size of the database and the number of enabled threads of redo. The size is not related to the frequency of updates to the database.

Typically, the space required for block change tracking is approximately 1/30,000 the size of the data blocks to be tracked. The following two factors that may cause the file to be larger than this estimate suggests:
To avoid overhead of allocating space as database grows, the change tracking file size starts at 10MB, and new space is allocated in 10MB increments. Thus, for any database up to approximately 300GB the file size is no smaller than 10MB, for up to approximately 600GB the file size is no smaller than 20MB, and so on.
For each datafile, a minimum of 320K of space is allocated in the change tracking file, regardless of the size of the file. Thus, if you have a large number of relatively small datafiles, the change tracking file is larger than for databases with a smaller number of larger datafiles containing the same data.

```sql
SELECT FILE#, INCREMENTAL_LEVEL, COMPLETION_TIME, BLOCKS, DATAFILE_BLOCKS FROM V$BACKUP_DATAFILE WHERE INCREMENTAL_LEVEL > 0 AND BLOCKS / DATAFILE_BLOCKS > .5 ORDER BY COMPLETION_TIME;
```
