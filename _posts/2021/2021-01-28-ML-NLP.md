1. Familiarize yourself with the original paper on word2vec - Mikolov et al. (2013)
   (http://papers.nips.cc/paper/5021-distributed-representations-of-words-and-phrases-and-their-
   compositionality.pdf). To learn more about the system and how to train your own vectors, you can
   find more information here (https://code.google.com/archive/p/word2vec). To learn about the
   python wrapper around Word2vec, you can find more information here (https://rare-
