This is an ever updating list, and this more of list for myself than to share with people.
I have hardly few of these books and all the information is compiled from fellow learners, industry experts, data scientists.

Text book 

* Machine Learning - Mitchell
  http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~tom/mlbook-chapter-slides.html


* Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras, &Tensorflow


* Murphy Machine Learning: A probabilistic perspective

* Machine Learning and Algorithmic Perspective - Stephen Marsland.
  
* Understanding Machine Learning: From Theory to Algorithms Textbook by Shai Ben-David and Shai Shalev-Shwartz (Math heavy).

* Pattern Recognition and ML by Bishop (Math heavy).
  
* Decision Making Under Uncertainty (Used in Stanford 228).
